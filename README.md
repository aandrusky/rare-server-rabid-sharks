# RARE Publishing Platform Server in Python

> Nashville Software School Group Project for Rabid Sharks

## The Concept

This server code pairs with the Rare Publishing Platform React App which can be found here https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-44/rare-rabid-sharks

Rare App allows users to make, view, edit, and comment their own posts, as well as the posts of other users

## Features

* Full CRUD endpoints for Users, Posts, Tags, Categories, Comments.
* Query endpoints to return data lists by various id categories.
* Access and control of database through SQLite statements.

## Setting Up Database

### Pulling down the Server-Side Repo. 
 
> Note: This project is meant to run simultaneously with the Client-Side Repo found here: https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-44/rare-rabid-sharks  
 
> Depending on which repo you start with, you may already have the following directories set up.  
> This project requires Python  
 
### To Begin installing the Server-Side Repo, complete the following steps: 
 
1. Create a directory from which to deploy the application. 
	
```mkdir RARE ```
 
2. Within RARE, create two sub-directories, CLIENT and SERVER 

```mkdir CLIENT ```
	
```mkdir SERVER ```
 
3. Navigate into the SERVER sub-directory. 
 
```cd CLIENT ```
 
4. Enter the following commands: 
	
```git clone git@github.com:nss-day-cohort-44/rare-rabid-sharks.git .``` <-- note the single 	
dot preceded by a single space.  
 
5. Create a virtual environment: 
```pipenv shell```

6. Once the virtual environment is created, install the 3rd-party software. 

```pipenv install autopep8 watchgod ```

7. Enter in the following command to start your new data server written in Python: 

```watchgod request_handler.main ```

> If there are no errors in the code, you will see the following, terse output:  
 
```watchgod request_handler.main [09:34:37] watching "/Users/.../workspace/python-server" and reloading "request_handler.main" on changesâ€¦```
